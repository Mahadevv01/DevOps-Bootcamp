# DevOps Bootcamp

Welcome to the DevOps Bootcamp! This README provides a concise overview of key DevOps topics that will be covered during the program.

## Topics Overview

### 1. **Docker**
- Docker is a platform for containerizing applications, enabling consistency across different environments.
- Key Concepts:
  - Images and Containers
  - Dockerfile
  - Docker Compose
- Benefits: Simplified deployment, portability, and isolation.

### 2. **Kubernetes**
- Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool for managing containerized applications at scale.
- Key Concepts:
  - Pods, Deployments, and Services
  - ConfigMaps and Secrets
  - Scaling and Load Balancing
- Benefits: Automates scaling, deployment, and management of containers.

### 3. **Networking**
- Networking is a fundamental component of DevOps, ensuring reliable communication between services and systems.
- Key Topics:
  - IP addressing and Subnetting
  - DNS and Load Balancers
  - Network Security (Firewalls, VPNs)

### 4. **GitHub Actions**
- GitHub Actions is a CI/CD tool integrated with GitHub for automating workflows.
- Key Concepts:
  - Workflows and Jobs
  - Triggers (push, pull requests, etc.)
  - Integration with third-party services

### 5. **YAML**
- YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format used for configuration files.
- Key Features:
  - Hierarchical data representation
  - Widely used in tools like Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and Ansible.

### 6. **AWS**
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a leading cloud platform providing infrastructure and services for DevOps.
- Key Services:
  - EC2 (Virtual Servers)
  - S3 (Storage)
  - IAM (Identity and Access Management)
  - CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code)
